# Torcherino 1.14-pre
Torcherino is a mod which provides torches and now jack o' lanterns which speed up the ticks of blocks placed within range.

## Notable changes
- Recipe to convert a lanterino back to a torcherino is gone, now you can break the lanterino whilst holding the modifier key to get both the carved pumpkin and torcherino.
- Updated assets to look like the new minecraft resources.
- Overpowered recipe configuration option is gone, recipes can now be changed through data packs.
- Screen for changing speed and mode (speed can be changed in increments of 100%'s using left and right arrow keys)
- Ability to change how torcherino's interact with redstone, can now be:
  - Normal (Torcherino is enabled when there is no signal present)
  - Inverted (Torcherino is enabled when there is a signal present)
  - Ignore (Torcherino is always enabled)

## TODO List
- [x] Basic mod functionality
- [x] New Assets
- [x] Redstone support
- [x] Configurable keybind
- [ ] General mod configuration
